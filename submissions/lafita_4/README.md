# Description

The peptide bond links amino acids together to generate proteins, the working units of biology. 
Likewise, the *BioJava Project* links together a large community of programmers to generate software for bioinformatics.

The logo favicon is designed with a flat ball and stick representation of the peptide bond as a negative figure in a green circle.
Balls are colored according to their Atom type: red oxygen, blue nitrogen, black carbon and grey hydrogen. 
The favicon can be turned into the O letter in the **BioJava** word, written in big with the Ubuntu font type.

The idea of the favicon as the letter O in the big **BioJava** word was suggested by Jose.
