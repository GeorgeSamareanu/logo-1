Submitting
==========

Submissions are made through github pull requests.

1. Create a fork of the [logo repository](https://github.com/biojava/logo)

2. Create a subdirectory in `submissions` with your name. If you plan to submit multiple submissions, you may want to number them (e.g. `submissions/biojava_1`).

3. Create your submission. Ideally, it should be in a vector-based format like SVG.

3. Name your most detailed submission as `logo.svg`. If you have additional versions of the logo they can be added as well (for instance, a version with minimal detail could be called `logo_favicon.svg`). Including PNG versions of the logos as well can make it easier to review, since these are automatically displayed by github.

4. (Optional) Include a README.md file with your name, contact information, and any additional information relevant to your submission.

5. Commit your submission to your fork, then create a pull request to the main [biojava/logo](https://github.com/biojava/logo) repository.

If there are any problems with your submission we'll let you know via comments on the pull request. Otherwise pull requests should be merged into the main repository within a few days.

Submitting via email
--------------------

We strongly prefer to take submissions via pull requests. However, if you don't have a github account or aren't comfortable with git, submissions can also be sent to the [biojava-l@biojava.org](http://biojava.org/wikis/BioJava:MailingLists/) mailing list.
