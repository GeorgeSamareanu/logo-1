Description

The color of the logo was inspired by the lush island of Java, as well as the color of growth and biology. I chose one of my favorite fonts for the text, which I think captures the whimsical nature of the Bioinformatics community. Finally, the shape of the logo represents similtaneously the digital genotype of biology (in the shape of the bit '0'), and the continuous phenotypes we typically observe (symbolized by the circle).
