# BioJava New Logo Design Competition

The current BioJava logo is very basic. With the upcoming new BioJava v. 5.0 release it is time for branding ourselves with a new logo.

We are hosting a **competition to design a new logo** for the BioJava project.

Anybody can participate according to the following rules:

* Submit your logo as a pull request for this project. Please follow the **[instructions for submitting](submissions/README.md)**.

* Logos shall not look similar in any way to the trademarked Java programming language logo. This means no coffee cups in any way.

* A submission shall not be in violation with any copyrighted or trademarked work.

* All contributed content will be under the [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## Timeframe

All contributions must be uploaded by the end of July 4th 2016.

## Announcement of Winner

The winner of the new logo competition will be announced during BOSC 2016.

## Prize

* We will print t-shirts with the new logo and the designer will get a free t-shirt.

* If the designer of the winning new logo will be attending ISMB 2016, the attending BioJava developers will take the winner out for dinner.

* BioJava will carry the new logo on its homepage and GitHub Profile.
 
## Desired features

 * The logo should look modern and be better than the current one (yellow circle)
 
 * The logo should be submitted as SVG graphics 
 
 * The logo should be able to be rendered as a favicon, as well as large (e.g. on a t-shirt). A design that provides two different versions (small and large rendering) is acceptable.
