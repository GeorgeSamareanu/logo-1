# BioJava New Logo Design Competition

The current BioJava logo is very basic. With the upcoming new BioJava v. 5.0 release it is time for branding ourselves with a new logo.

We are hosting a `competition to design a new logo` for the BioJava project.

Anybody can participate according to the following rules:

* Submit your logo as a pull request for this project. If appropriate we will comment and make suggestions for logos.

* Logos shall not look similar in any way to Oracle's trademarked Java logo. I.e. no coffee cups.

* No Logo shall be in violation with any other copyrighted or trademarked work.

* All contributed content will be under the [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## Timeframe

All contributions must be uploaded by the end of July 4th 2016.

## Announcement of Winner

The winner of the new logo competition will be announced during BOSC 2016.

## Prize

* We will print t-shirts with the new logo and the designer will get a free t-shirt.

* If the designer of the winning new logo will be attending ISMB, the attending BioJava developers will take the winner out for dinner.

* BioJava will carry the new logo on its homepage and GitHub Profile.
